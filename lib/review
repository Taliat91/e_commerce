1. Your choiice of color has been in sync with theme of the app, look for a primary color from the design to use aas your theme color. The Green is not looking like it.
Although most designs you will be working on will have the login and signup designed.

//SplashScreen
Well implemented

After Splashscreen, always show a login page instead of a signup page first. So users can click tthe signup button to go to the signup.

//Bonus
After signing up you can also take users to the Homepage instead of coming back to login page. Some designs will have it liike that too

Great validation in sign up page and on login page.

Bottom Bar looks good. Nice

After the top categories, the other contents are to small to scroll from, increase the size.
